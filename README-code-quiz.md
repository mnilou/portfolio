# code-quiz javascript

# Description
This app is a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. It runs in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, adapting to multiple screen sizes.

This app begins when the "start" button is clicked to play the JavaScript quiz game. The user has 60 seconds to complete the quiz. However, every question you get wrong will deduct 5 seconds from the time left. The game ends when the user finishes answering the questions or when the time is up, whichever happens first. The users score will be the time remaining. Their initials can entered at the end of the game to compete with others to see who will get the highest score.
