# password-template

## Description 
The object of this website is to generate a unique password with specific parameters. The password generator page is designed to create a strong password that provides greater security. For example, an employee with access to sensitive data would need a password that meets most, if not all, password protection criteria such as special characters, upper case, numbers, etc.

Using Javascript programming language, the dynamic site takes the users input and creates a password using specific prompts, arrays, conditional statements, functions, math, and loops.

Difficulties I ran into was being new to Javascript, basically learning the language, while completing this task. There are a lot of methods to accomplishing the same task and it can get confusing applying one.
