# first-portfolio

## Description 

This project is a portfolio for a full stack web developer. The project contains three pages consisting of About Me, Portfolio, and Contact Me. The goal was to make a marketable webpage that is user-friendly across many screens.

The object of this project is to make a responsive design for mobile-first application. The project uses Bootstrap, CSS and inline HTML styling with media queries. It includes a responsive layout and images. 

Bootstrap is the first application used on this site with CSS style sheet as reference for stylistic changes and media queries. Although I tried to stay within the Bootstrap framework, I had too many universal changes for inline styling. Personalizing the design required a separate CSS stylesheet.
